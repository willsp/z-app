# Z-App

A simple webapp to make a list continuously scroll in either direction... no plugins or libraries allowed.

To run this full width, up to 1200 pixels, switch to "var-width" branch.

## To Install

Be sure to have [nodejs][1] and [grunt-cli][2] installed.

    git clone https://github.com/willsp/z-app
    cd z-app
    npm install
    grunt serve

Got the video playing on mobile... however, still can't figure how to get it to play inline on the iPhone.
This makes for a very poor experience... pretty much unusable. Will need to figure that out or reimplement
to only play through, once.
